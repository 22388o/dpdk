/// NUMA node numbers start at zero.

/// It is assumed by DPDK code that there is always at least one NUMA node, and, if there is one NUMA node, it is number zero.
///
/// Some DPDK APIs (eg `rte_eth_dev_socket_id`) treat zero as also meaning 'undetermined'.
///
/// NUMA node numbers are not necessarily contiguous but usually are.
///
/// NUMA nodes are also, confusingly, known as sockets. In this sense they represent the socket where a modern CPU with multiple cores resides.
