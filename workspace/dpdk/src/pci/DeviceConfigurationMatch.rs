/*
	Match an ethernet configuration
		- by SupportedDevice (eg BroadcomBnxt_ChipNumber_57301)
		- by PCI Device Address
		- by Driver (eg BroadcomBnxt)
		- by Vendor (eg Broadcom)

		- by NUMA socket
		- by number of ports on the card (everything bar Mellanox)

eth_dev_info returns a struct that include DriverName
this is something like "xen virtio PMD"
	=> we can match on this
*/
