	///
	/// If running interactively `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are intercepted and will be re-raised (using libc's `raise()`) after handling so that any parent shell can behave correctly.
	///
	/// Always returns normally; panics are handled and logged.
	///
	/// The return value is an exit code in the range 0 - 127 inclusive which should be passed to `std::process::exit()`. Currenty values are:-
	///
	/// * `0`: successful
	/// * `70`: (aka `EX_SOFTWARE`) - something panicked
	///
	/// Notes:-
	///
	/// * The daemon `irqbalance` should not really be run when this program is running. It isn't incompatible per se, but it isn't useful.
	/// * It is recommended to boot the kernel with the command line parameter `irqaffinity` set to the inverse of `isolcpus`.
	/// * If running causes Linux Kernel modules to load, these are **not** unloaded at process exit as we no longer have the permissions to do so,
	/// * Likewise, if we mount `hugeltbfs` it is not unmounted (and, if we created its mount point folder, this is not deleted) at process exit.
