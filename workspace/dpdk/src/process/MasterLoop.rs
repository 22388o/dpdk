	// default_smp_affinity != irqaffinity on kernel command line?

// TODO: Do we always want to set the socket-memory ?
	// perhaps we want it uncapped; perhaps we don;t always want to garbage collect, etc

// TODO: Do we want to use libc's malloc and friends (eg aligned_alloc) for HybridGlobalAllocator
	// - we need a way to track whose memory is whose.
	// - we can use unsafe { rte_malloc_validate(pointer, null() } == -1  to detect non-DPDK memory, as the cost of making realloc / free more expensive than current.
	// musl doesn't seem to provide a way to detect if memory was allocated by it.
	// We could use increased allocations by abusing size / alignment
		// eg if asked to allocate 256 bytes, 16 byte aligned we allocate 272 bytes, reserving 16 bytes for ourselves.
		// eg we could use jemalloc.

impl MasterLoop
{
	/// Executes a program which uses DPDK.
	///
	/// Panics may be caught but are re-raised.
	///
	/// If running interactively `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are intercepted and will be re-raised if caught so that any parent shell can behave correctly.
	///
	/// The `hybrid_global_allocator` should be declared globally in `main.rs` as `#[global_allocator] static ALLOCATOR: HybridGlobalAllocator = HybridGlobalAllocator::new();`
	///
	/// Notes:-
	///
	/// * The daemon `irqbalance` should not really be run when this program is running. It isn't incompatible per se, but it isn't useful.
	/// * It is recommended to boot the kernel with the command line parameter `irqaffinity` set to the inverse of `isolcpus`.
	/// * If running causes Linux Kernel modules to load, these are **not** unloaded at process exit as we no longer have the permissions to do so,
	/// * Likewise, if we mount `hugeltbfs` it is not unmounted (and, if we created its mount point folder, this is not deleted) at process exit.
