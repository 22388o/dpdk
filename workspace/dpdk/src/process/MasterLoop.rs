	/// The `hybrid_global_allocator` should be declared globally in `main.rs` as `#[global_allocator] static ALLOCATOR: HybridGlobalAllocator = HybridGlobalAllocator::new();`.
	///
	/// The number of logical cores used is calculated by examining the Linux command line kernel parameters.
	///
	/// It is recommended that Linux run with at least 2 cores assigned to the Kernel; one of these will be used as a master logical core, and the other will be used for control threads as necessary. Neither usage is particularly high or critical.
	///
	/// If running interactively `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` are intercepted and will be re-raised (using libc's `raise()`) after handling so that any parent shell can behave correctly.
	///
	/// Always returns normally; panics are handled and logged.
	///
	/// The return value is an exit code in the range 0 - 127 inclusive which should be passed to `std::process::exit()`. Currenty values are:-
	///
	/// * `0`: successful
	/// * `70`: (aka `EX_SOFTWARE`) - something panicked
	///
	/// Notes:-
	///
	/// * The daemon `irqbalance` should not really be run when this program is running. It isn't incompatible per se, but it isn't useful.
	/// * It is recommended to boot the kernel with the command line parameter `irqaffinity` set to the inverse of `isolcpus`.
	/// * If running causes Linux Kernel modules to load, these are **not** unloaded at process exit as we no longer have the permissions to do so,
	/// * Likewise, if we mount `hugeltbfs` it is not unmounted (and, if we created its mount point folder, this is not deleted) at process exit.
