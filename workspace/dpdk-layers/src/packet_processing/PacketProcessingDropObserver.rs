/// Allows for notification of dropped packets.
pub trait PacketProcessingDropObserver
{
	/// Notifies the observer that a packet has been dropped.
	///
	/// Things that can be done with this information:-
	///
	/// * Log to syslog.
	/// * Log to standard error.
	/// * Log to an in-memory ring buffer which can be 'inspected' (this has the advantage of fixing memory usage).
	/// * Increment a statistic, such as a counter.
	/// * Use injected Lua
	/// * Pass to a security monitor which can reactively and automatically adjust configuration (eg ban an IP address).
	/// * Ignore.
	///
	/// One additional possible idea, not yet supported, would to allow the observer to mutate the packet and 're-inject' it or 'reject' the drop. This is fraught with potential pitfalls.
