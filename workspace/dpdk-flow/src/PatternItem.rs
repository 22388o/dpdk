	/// A matcher that matches an ethernet header.
	///
	/// When followed by a 'layer 2.5' matcher such as VirtualLanHeaderPacketMatcher, the Ether Type is a tag protocol identifier (TPID).
	/// In this case, the ether type refers to the outer header, with the VirtualLanHeaderPacketMatcher's ether type referring to the inner Ether Type or tag protocol identifier (TPID).

	///
	/// Not all devices will support a fuzzy match.
	///
	/// Usually a fuzzy match is fast but the cost is accuracy, eg Signature Match only match pattern's hash value, but it is possible two different patterns have the same hash value.
	///
	/// Matching accuracy level can be configure by a `threshold`.
	///
	/// These are mapped internally by a DPDK driver to the different accuracy levels that the underlying device supports.
	/// * a `threshold` of zero (0) is a perfect match.

	/// A mark match matches a packet that has previously been 'marked' with a marking action.
	/// Marks are stored inside the `rte_mbuf` in the same union as the Receive Side Scaling (RSS) hash.

	/// This item can be provided several times to match additional physical ports.
	///
	/// Note that physical ports are not necessarily tied to DPDK input ports (`port_id`) when those are not under DPDK control.
	/// Possible values are specific to each device, they are not necessarily indexed from zero and may not be contiguous.

	/// As a device property, the list of allowed values as well as the value associated with a `port_id` should be retrieved by other means.

	/// Normally only supported if the port identifier in question is known by the underlying PMD and related to the device the flow rule is created against.

	/// A port identifier is the application-side way of referring to 'ethernet' connections and getting reference to `eth_dev` structures.
	PortIdentifier(MaskedPacketMatcherFields<u32, u32>),

	///
	/// * Can be specified multiple times to match traffic addressed to several Virtual Function (VF) Identifiers (IDs).
