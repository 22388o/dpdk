/*
	METER is interesting. It applied a 'color' to an (IP) packet (optionally taking into account the DSCP / DiffServ field - we pass a table of 64 colors, one for each diffserv value). It can then (with the policer) drop the packet or adjust the color.
	
	Finally, color is put in 'rte_mbuf.sched.color' according to the docs. This doesn't exist.
	There is rte_mbuf.hash.sched.as_ref().lo or .hi
	
	The initial table can be updated over the life of the meter, allowing dynamic policy changes
	
	There is also traffic management: rte_tm_level_capabilities_get et al.
	
	The referenced meter identifier needs to have already been created...
