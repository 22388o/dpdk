/// Fuzzy pattern match.
///
/// Not all devices will support a fuzzy match.
///
/// Usually a fuzzy match is fast but the cost is accuracy, eg Signature Match only match pattern's hash value, but it is possible two different patterns have the same hash value.
///
/// Matching accuracy level can be configure by a `threshold`.
///
/// These are mapped internally by a DPDK driver to the different accuracy levels that the underlying device supports.
