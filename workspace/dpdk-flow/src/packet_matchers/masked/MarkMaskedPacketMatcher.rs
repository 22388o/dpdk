/// Mark pattern match.
///
/// Not all devices will support a mark match, and, of those that do, not all will support the full range from 0 to 2^32 - 1 inclusive.
///
/// A mark match matches a packet that has previously been 'marked' with a marking action. Marks are stored inside the `rte_mbuf` in the same union as the Receive Side Scaling (RSS) hash.
///
/// As of DPDK 18.05, this functionality is experimental.
