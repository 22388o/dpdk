/// Matches traffic originating from (ingress) or going to (egress) a physical port of the underlying device.
///
/// The first PhysicalPortPacketMatcher overrides the physical port normally associated with the specified DPDK input port (`port_id`).
/// This item can be provided several times to match additional physical ports.
///
/// Note that physical ports are not necessarily tied to DPDK input ports (`port_id`) when those are not under DPDK control.
/// Possible values are specific to each device, they are not necessarily indexed from zero and may not be contiguous.
///
/// As a device property, the list of allowed values as well as the value associated with a `port_id` should be retrieved by other means.
