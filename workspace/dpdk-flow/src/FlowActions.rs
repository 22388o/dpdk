/// The actions to take when a flow rule matches.
///
/// The following DPDK actions are not supported and no implementation is planned:-
///
/// * `VOID` (as it is of no benefit in this API).
/// * `SECURITY` (related to hardware offloading of IPSec and crypograhic algorithms).
/// * `OF_SET_MPLS_TTL` (sets the MPLS hops count).
/// * `OF_DEC_MPLS_TTL` (decrements the MPLS hops count).
/// * `OF_SET_NW_TTL` (sets the Internet Protocol hops count).
/// * `OF_DEC_NW_TTL` (decrements the Internet Protocol hops count).
/// * `OF_COPY_TTL_OUT`
/// * `OF_COPY_TTL_IN`
/// * `OF_POP_VLAN`
/// * `OF_PUSH_VLAN`
/// * `OF_SET_VLAN_VID` (sets the IEEE 802.1q Virtual LAN identifier).
/// * `OF_SET_VLAN_PCP` (sets the IEEE 802.1q Virtual LAN priority).
/// * `OF_POP_MPLS`
/// * `OF_PUSH_MPLS`
/// * `VXLAN_ENCAP`
/// * `VXLAN_DECAP`
/// * `NVGRE_ENCAP`
/// * `NVGRE_DECAP`
///
/// Note that the `END` DPDK action is applied automatically.
