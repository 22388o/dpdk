//! #dpdk-process
//! Abstractions for a process (program, application) using DPDK on many hyper-threaded cores.
//!
//! Whilst DPDK is supported for Linux on AArch64, ARM v7, PowerPC 64-bit (recent) and x86-64, and FreeBSD on x86-64, only Linux x86-64 will compile.
//!
//! Some work has been done to try to maintain compatibility with FreeBSD and other architectures but this is not maintained yet.
