//! #dpdk-global-allocator
//! A wrapper around DPDK's packet distributor framework with support for slave logical cores and service logical cores.
//!
//! An user of this crate should create an instance of `PacketDistributorControllerLoop` and then use DPDK's slave logical cores or service logical cores to run it repeatedly. This particular loop implementation distributes packets to workers ***but does not*** process returned packets.
//!
//! DPDK's underlying code never reserves but never frees memory on creation... potentially limiting the usefulness of this framework.
//!
//! Whilst DPDK is supported for Linux on AArch64, ARM v7, PowerPC 64-bit (recent) and x86-64, and FreeBSD on x86-64, only Linux x86-64 will compile.
//!
//! Some work has been done to try to maintain compatibility with FreeBSD and other architectures but this is not maintained yet.
