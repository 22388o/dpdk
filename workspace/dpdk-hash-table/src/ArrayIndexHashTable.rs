/// Represents a hash table optimized for hardware transactional memory and the AVX2 and SSE instruction sets, which instead of values stores indices.
///
/// The indices are allocated and freed internally by the hash table; the range of indices is from `0 .. capacity` (exclusive).
///
/// `capacity` is limited to 1,073,741,824 (`RTE_HASH_ENTRIES_MAX`).
///
/// A typical pattern of usage for this hash table is to pair it with an array or Vector of memory of the same capacity.
///
/// Insertions may be thread unsafe or thread safe, depending on how the hash table was constructed.
/// The hash table does not resize in use.
/// The hash table is NUMA-aware, and is best used within one NUMA node.
/// The hash table provides in-place access to values.
///
/// A limitation in the DPDK API means it is not possible to use Rust's `BuildHasher` trait, however, it can use the same default as Rust's hash map if `HasherType` is `std::collections::hash_map::DefaultHasher`.
///
/// Key equality can be either byte-wise or using the implementation of the trait `Eq`. In the latter case, insertion is thread unsafe.
